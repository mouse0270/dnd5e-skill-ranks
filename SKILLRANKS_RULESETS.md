# Skill Ranks

## How do I gain ranks?
To keep the system inline with and compatible with most of what D&D5e provides both core and homebrew, you gain a skill rank point every time you gain a skill proficency. Skill Ranks are can be user defined but we provide a basic template which starts at `Untrained (0)` and goes to `Legendary (5)`. Untrainined grants you no bonus, and every rank above grants you a bonus  equal to that rank. Any skill in which you are proficient in you have at least 1 rank in.

| Rank | Title         | Proficiency Bonus |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0    | Untrained     | +0                |
| 1    | Knowledgeable | +2                |
| 2    | Trained       | +3                |
| 3    | Expert        | +4                | 
| 4    | Master        | +5                |
| 5    | Legendary     | +6                |

## Ruleset #1 (D&D5e Scaling)
This first ruleset keeps skill bonuses mostly inline with how core D&D 5e works. This means you will get skill ranks much more frequently.

### How do I gain ranks?
When you gain a skill proficiency, you instead gain a skill rank. Lets use **Yaror Axeguard** our Dwarven Fighter with the Solider Background as an example. At level 1, Yaror gains 2 skill proficiencies from his class of fighter, and 2 skill proficiencies from his background of Solider. These proficiencies are Yarors, skill ranks. Yaror automatically gains the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` from his background in both `Athletics` and `Intimidation`, but that leaves him with 2 ranks he can still spend. Yaror then chooses to spend one rank in `Acrobatics` granting him the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` and his last rank in `Athletics` bumping his rank from `Knowledgeable (+2)` to `Trained (+3)`.

### How do I level up my skills ranks then?
Each time you level up after level 1, you are granted 1 skill rank to spend to spend on any skill you would like. You can choose to increase the rank of a skill you already have ranks in, or you can choose to pick up a new skill. 

Additionally at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 you gain 2 additional skill ranks for a total of 3 skill ranks at that level. Assuming you start with 4-6 Skill Ranks at level 1, at level 20 you should end with 33-35 Skill Ranks. This means you could be `knowledgeable (+2)` in all of the skills but that would only leave you with about 15-17 skill points to spend on your remaining skills, allowing you to level up max out 4-5 other skills or having a variation of other ranks. Keep in mind, Skill Ranks do not use your Class Proficiency Bonus. so spending your points out like this might seem great, but could really limit your character on their other skills.

> **Optional Rule:** Limit the max rank of a skill to the total character proficiency bonus. For example a character between the leves of 1-4 your max skill rank per skill would be 2. Levels 5-8 your max skill rank would be 3. Levels 9-12 your max skill rank would be 4, etc.

### Skill Points Per Level
This is a quick table to show you how many skill ranks you should have per level. This list doesn't include any extra ranks you gain via your Race, Class, Background or Feats.

| Level | Ranks Granted | Minimum Ranks |-| Level | Ranks Granted | Minimum Ranks |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 1     | 0*            | 0*            |-| 11    | 1             | 14            |
| 2     | 1             | 1             |-| 12    | 3             | 17            |
| 3     | 1             | 2             |-| 13    | 1             | 18            |
| 4     | 3             | 5             |-| 14    | 1             | 19            |
| 5     | 1             | 6             |-| 15    | 1             | 20            |
| 6     | 1             | 7             |-| 16    | 3             | 23            |
| 7     | 1             | 8             |-| 17    | 1             | 24            |
| 8     | 3             | 11            |-| 18    | 1             | 25            |
| 9     | 1             | 12            |-| 19    | 1             | 26            |
| 10    | 1             | 13            |-| 20    | 3             | 29            |

> \* Level 1 you start with a number of skill ranks equal to the skill proficiencies gained from your Race, Class, Background or Feats


## Ruleset #1 (Pathfinder 2e Based)
This ruleset is based off of how you gain skill ranks in PF2e. This means you will get far fewer skill ranks as you level up. This means overall players will have lower skill bonus but it should make skills feel more impactful when used.

### How do I gain ranks?
When you gain a skill proficiency, you instead gain a skill rank. Lets use **Yaror Axeguard** our Dwarven Fighter with the Solider Background as an example. At level 1, Yaror gains 2 skill proficiencies from his class of fighter, and 2 skill proficiencies from his background of Solider. These proficiencies are Yarors, skill ranks. Yaror automatically gains the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` from his background in both `Athletics` and `Intimidation`, but that leaves him with 2 ranks he can still spend. Yaror then chooses to spend one rank in `Acrobatics` granting him the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` and his last rank in `Athletics` bumping his rank from `Knowledgeable (+2)` to `Trained (+3)`.

### How do I level up my skills ranks then?
You gain one skill rank every other level starting at level 2. Meaning you are granted 1 skill point at level 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20. This means from level 1-2 you only gain 10 skill ranks to spend. You still get skill ranks when ever you gain a skill proficiency via any feature that gives you a skill proficiency. 

Assuming you start with 4-6 Skill Ranks at Level 1, at level 20 you should end with about 14-16 skill ranks. Taking feats such as Skilled or improving your base ability modifiers will have a much greater impact on your skill bonus. This means you could be `knowledgeable (+2)` in all but two to four skills by level 20. Or you could be legendary in 2-3 skills. 

The main difference in using this ruleset is that instead of assuming you get better at a skill simply because you gained a level, it requires players to choose which skills they went to get better at.
