# Skill Ranks for D&D 5e
Skill ranks simply put is an overly complicated system designed an in attempt to make skills feel more specialized to individual players. I've always found that having skill bound to players character level didn't make them feel special as they leveled up. A Barbarian gets the same bonus to Stealth as a Rouge does when they level up. The characters get no control over this.

## How does Skill Ranks work?
Skills now have an additional property called rank, and this rank varies from `Untrained (0)` to `Legendary (5)`. Instead of gaining proficiency in a skill, you choose to gain a rank in that skill. Having any rank above `Untrained` in a skill, makes you proficient in that skill. Skills Proficiency Bonus is now based off this new rank instead of your character level. Use the following table to find out the bonus each rank grants you

| Rank | Title         | Proficiency Bonus |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0    | Untrained     | +0                |
| 1    | Knowledgeable | +2                |
| 2    | Trained       | +3                |
| 3    | Expert        | +4                | 
| 4    | Master        | +5                |
| 5    | Legendary     | +6                |

## How do I gain ranks?
When you gain a skill proficiency, you instead gain a skill rank. Lets use **Yaror Axeguard** our Dwarven Fighter with the Solider Background as an example. At level 1, Yaror gains 2 skill proficiencies from his class of fighter, and 2 skill proficiencies from his background of Solider. These proficiencies are Yarors, skill ranks. Yaror automatically gains the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` from his background in both `Athletics` and `Intimidation`, but that leaves him with 2 ranks he can still spend. Yaror then chooses to spend one rank in `Acrobatics` granting him the rank of `Knowledgeable (+2)` and his last rank in `Athletics` bumping his rank from `Knowledgeable (+2)` to `Trained (+3)`. 

## How do I level up my skills ranks then?
Each time you level up after level 1, you are granted 1 skill rank to spend to spend on any skill you would like. You can choose to increase the rank of a skill you already have ranks in, or you can choose to pick up a new skill. 

Additionally at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 you gain 2 additional skill ranks for a total of 3 skill ranks at that level. Assuming you start with 4-6 Skill Ranks at level 1, at level 20 you should end with 33-35 Skill Ranks. This means you could be `knowledgeable (+2)` in all of the skills but that would only leave you with about 15-17 skill points to spend on your remaining skills, allowing you to level up max out 4-5 other skills or having a variation of other ranks. Keep in mind, Skill Ranks do not use your Class Proficiency Bonus. so spending your points out like this might seem great, but could really limit your character on their other skills.

## How does Expertise work?
Exactly the same, it simply doubles whatever your Skill Rank Proficiency Bonus is. For example, if you have Expertise in a skill with the rank of `Trained` your Bonus doubles to `+6` and if you have it in `Legendary` it doubles too `+12`

## What happens if I take the Skilled Feat?
You gain additional skill ranks instead of skill proficiencies? The system is designed to work with most of the core of D&D5e but just so that skills have their own Proficiency Bonuses instead of being tied to the characters level.

## Alright, but what about Jack of All Trades?
Well you finally got me, this one is a little tricky. Jack of all trades sets your minimum proficiency bonus to half of your character level proficiency bonuses regardless of your rank in that class. Meaning if your Rank would be lower, you will be at least at the value of Jack of All Trades.
